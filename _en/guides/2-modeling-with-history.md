The aim of this tutorial is to learn how to establish the connection between command inputs and the result. It
will also explore modeling aids, boolean operations, linked blocks and introduce both grasshopper for modeling and Raytraced (Cycles) for rendering.

## 2.1 Direct Modeling

Direct modeling is very comparable to pen and paper. Designers usually get the hang of direct modeling fairly quickly for few reasons:

- The general workflow is similar to using pen and paper.
- There is not too much upfront work that the designers need to do other than opening the application and start drawing, albeit digitally.
- Actions (or commands) are typically intuitive and easy to remember. You can guess many of them (type a couple of letters, and the smart autocomplete will pull a list for you to choose from). All tools are also grouped in a logical arrangement in menus and toolbars.
- Once you run a command, it usually guides you through the process step by step.
